According to the Center for Disease Control, that’s more deaths than were caused by car crashes, HIV, or gun violences. It’s criminal. Literally... AN EPIDEMIC CREATED BY THE GREED OF OPIOID MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. They knew the risks when they marketed them to doctors across the nation as allegedly safe and non-addictive. They lied, and our loved ones died! it’s time for them to pay for their crimes and fund the recovery, prevention & treatment resources we need. /n Not one more life!',

A Dean’s List Economics graduate from the University of Minnesota, he ran marathons, excelled in soccer, and was a gifted musician.  Suffering with chronic pain for 15 years, Steve was prescribed opioids by a well-intentioned doctor taught that opioids were safe and effective for long-term use.  “At first they were a lifeline.  Now they are a noose around my neck.” Leaving behind a devoted fiancé and family, Steve died from the disease of addiction, brought on by the over-prescribing of painkillers. Prescribed Opioids Killed Steve!',
